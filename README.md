# 🔐 Password Generator (Python)

A simple and secure **Password Generator** built using Python. Customize the number of letters, numbers, and symbols to create strong, random passwords in seconds!

---

## 🚀 Features

- Generates strong and randomized passwords
- User-defined number of:
  - Letters (uppercase and lowercase)
  - Numbers
  - Symbols
- Uses `random.choice()` and `random.shuffle()` for better randomness
- Outputs the final password in a readable format

---

## 🧪 Example Output
<pre>
welcome to password generator!!!
enter number of letters in your password: 5
enter number of numbers in your password: 3
enter number of symbols in your password: 2
Your password is:2aR@8Kc&1

</pre>

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Python lists and string manipulation
- Loops (`for` and `range`)
- `random.choice()` to pick characters
- `random.shuffle()` to mix the password
- User input with `input()` and `int()`
